# Configuration file
Like the server item in NGINX, the server is configured using a file. The following items can be set.

- **Choose the port and host of each ’server’.**
- **Setup the server_names or not.**
- **The first server for a host:port will be the default for this host:port (that means
it will answer to all the requests that don’t belong to an other server).**
- **Setup default error pages.**
- **Limit client body size.**
- **Setup routes with one or multiple of the following rules/configuration (routes won't be using regexp):**
  - Define a list of accepted HTTP methods for the route.
  - Define a HTTP redirection.
  - Define a directory or a file from where the file should be searched (for example, if url /kapouet is rooted to /tmp/www, url /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet is /tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet).
  - Turn on or off directory listing.
  - Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory.
  - Execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php).
  - Make the route able to accept uploaded files and configure where they should be saved.
